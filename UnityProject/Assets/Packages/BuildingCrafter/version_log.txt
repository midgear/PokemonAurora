============================
0.8.3 - Swinging Doors  | March 31st, 2019

============================
0.8.2 - Mistake Fixin'  | March 19th, 2019
============================

============================
0.8.1 - New Wall Generation Engine Update  | January 30th, 2019
============================

MAJOR - Building Crafter's base Unity version is now 2017.1.2. May work with earlier version.
MAJOR - Building walls / floors no longer use UV tiles. All surfaces have UVs between 0 and 1 (important for baking / atlasing).
MAJOR - Added simple Atlasing system for performance. 1 material (aka drawcall) a building's walls, floors, ceilings, roofs and overhangs.
MAJOR - All the walls can be generated on angles or at any length. However this is ONLY internal. So the editor doesn't support this yet. This is for future updates.

ADDED - Floors can be generated with top caps, useful for dungeon crawlers
ADDED - New door/window frame generator that lines up all UVs with the corresponding wall
ADDED - Atlas generator for building styles
ADDED - JSON export / import for buildings
ADDED - New building crown generation that does not use UV tiling, instead increased vertices (so buildings can atlas)
ADDED - Simple walking script to check out doors opening and closing in the test scene
ADDED - Option to generate a building as an Atlased building
CHANGED - All walls are generated without the old tesselator. No UV tiling anymore, but increased vertexes
CHANGED - All floors are generated without UV tiling, instead each floor tile is it's own square quad
CHANGED - Rooms are now split into 3 objects (floor, wall roof) instead of being a single object with multiple submeshes
CHANGED - Example textures no longer use tiling or offset outside of (1, 1) and (0, 0) respectively
CHANGED - Stair cutouts use new wall generation for dropdown
CHANGED - Outside walls no longer use submeshes for different materials, uses separate gameobjects instead per material
CHANGED - Roof lips / crowns have a new generation method without any UV tiling
CHANGED - Updated the Building crafter manual with how to create custom doors, JSON info, atlasing info and a few other things
FIXED - Undoing during live view will just regenerate the building at the last layout provided instead of saving and reloading the mesh that was generated
FIXED - Separate rooms on the same floor not connected to each other (for example, two towers) will now generate both exteriors
FIXED - Door hinges are now aligned on all example doors
KNOWN ISSUE - Textures meant to be atlased MUST have offset of (0,0) and tiling of (1, 1). Offset / Tile in your photo editing program
KNOWN ISSUE - Normal maps must be proper normal maps before being imported into Unity. Do not use Unity's normal map generation with atlasing of textures
KNOWN ISSUE - Rooms connected by kitty corner will create inverted walls and all sorts of issues
KNOWN ISSUE - Due to floating point problems if a surface appears black, try moving the building a meter or two away. Or send the building by email and a fix may be found

ADDED - Added base window to fit into any window space
ADDED - Eyedropper to select window and door types when creating new openings
ADDED - Two windows (fancy and base window) for use in any project
ADDED - Experimental Live View Mode. Some features (like roofs, yards and fancy walls) do not generate automatically. Send feedback please!

CHANGED - Window frames now generate with the buildings and rooms, slight triangle increase
CHANGED - Versioning number option MAJOR.MINOR.SMALL (example 0.8.0)
KNOWN ISSUES - Second floors that only touch the edge of the floor below do not generate correctly
