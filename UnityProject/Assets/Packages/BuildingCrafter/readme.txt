1. Building Crafter
============================

Thank you for purchasing Building Crafter! With this asset, you can quickly creating buildings from inside Unity.

Please leave a review or feel free to contact me at buildingcrafter@8bitgoose.com. This is an ongoing project and I intend to answer any of your questions within 24 hours.

More information can be found at 8bitgoose.com.


============================
2. Getting Started
============================

The system is designed to be used without a manual, however if you like a shiny PDF manual, please take a look at the manual created for Building Crafter. It can be found in the package folder.

Also, there are a few tutorial videos and examples at 8bitgoose.com.


============================
3. Design and Overview
============================

Building Crafter is designed from rooms, not from buildings. The external wall is then built from the sum of the rooms.

It is based on 1x1m grids for buildings.

It uses completely predictable standard widths. 
	• All floors are 3 meters high. 
	• All doors are 1m wide sections.
	• Windows are 0.5m sections
	• Ceilings are between 2m and 2.9m.
	• Walls are inset 10cm.
	• External walls are outset 10cm.
	• Any piece of furniture set within a 90cm by 90cm will fit anywhere in your building.

Buildings have two major components which are completely separate. Building Blueprints and Building Styles.

	• Building Blueprints are the layout of floors, doors, windows and stairs
	• Building Styles are how the building looks, including exterior textures, prefabs and building crown profiles.

Building Crafter is designed to be able to quickly build low poly, performant buildings which can be populated with furniture and allow large dense building worlds.

I've tested 91 buildings in a scene and had well above 60fps. If you have a more Building Crafter buildings in a scene, please send me an message at buildingcrafter@8bitgoose.com withs some proof and I'll add it to the record here.


============================
4. Simple Start
============================

1. Go GameObject > Create Building Crafter GameObject
2. Click create building while this GameObject is selected. This is a separate GameObject, think of it as as factory.
3. Start adding rooms. Make sure they connect, disconnected rooms will cause issues.
4. Add windows, doors, floors, stairs etc.
5. Click generate building. It will build your new building.


============================
5. Known Unity Issues
============================

• Unity's automatic baking can cause issues as Building Crafter deletes all meshes when generated. If it hangs often, turn off automatic lighting.
